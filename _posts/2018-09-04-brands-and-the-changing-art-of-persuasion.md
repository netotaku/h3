I recently attended a great morning session on strategy at the <a href="https://www.ycn.org/" target="_blank">You Can 
Now (YCN)</a> here in London. It included some fantastic insight from strategists who sit at different stages of their 
professional lives – James Lees (Sword & Stone) and Jim Carroll (ex-UK Chairman of BBH). Both made some great points, 
but the big takeaway from the talk for me was from Jim regarding ‘persuasion’, and that a part of our role as 
strategists remains to persuade. 

Persuasion is not the most fashionable of brand P-words right now – that honor goes to Purpose.

### Brand purpose can be positive

Purpose has become the phrase on every brand strategists lips, but unfortunately this is a phrase which I feel has 
become hijacked. Having a purpose for your brand is of course important, but how this is defined has become rather 
confused. For me, every brand should have a purpose or aspiration which they share with their audience. Whether this is 
a social purpose, such as minimizing plastic waste, or simply a shared aspiration, such as improving your fitness, this 
can encourage people to become interested and involved with a brand. (If you want to actually read some intelligent 
writing around brand purpose then try <a href="https://amzn.to/2Q0GYZL" target="_blank">Citizen Brands by Michael 
Willmott</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/2oECwmQ" target="_blank">Beyond Branding by Nicholas Ind</a> and 
<a href="https://amzn.to/2wG1W8c" target="_blank">Cannibals with Forks by John Elkington</a>)

But is defining a purpose for your brand simply another way to persuade people that they should be interested in your 
brand, or want to join your brand ‘tribe’? I believe there is a danger that we feel that persuasion is what those Mad 
Men advertising execs of the 60s/70s/80s/90s did, and now we want to have ‘conversations’ with our target audience on 
what the brand means to them.

Yes a brand must be shaped around a meaning which is shared with people, and brand communications should now be two way 
conversations in some form (in that we must actively listen to what people are saying). But as strategists, and 
importantly the people leading a brand, it is our role to always seek to move the conversation on and constantly seek to 
shape the conversation that is being had.

### A marketers role is to persuade

So is a part of our role still as persuaders? I may be wrong here, but I feel that many of today’s marketers consider 
persuasion to be beneath them. Talking about things like brand purpose help us make our role sound more worthwhile, and 
make us feel better about ourselves, but is there anything wrong with seeking to persuade?

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6435406409462013952" target="_blank">I shared the topic of 
persuasion on LinkedIn recently and was challenged by Merlin Duff</a> (strategy consultant at 
Venturethree) whether we seek to persuade or influence? Merlin’s delineation between the two was that ‘everything we do 
is about influence but not necessarily about persuasion (if by persuasion we mean persuading people to do/think/feel 
something).’ Although we agreed that there are semantics at play here, we did discuss the interesting difference between 
the two terms of persuasion and influence.

Personally, I question whether some strategists, marketers, etc might feel a little unnerved by the thought that they 
are encouraging people to do/think/feel something. If we are being tasked by a brand owner (whether as an external or 
internal expert) to help them with a specific challenge for their brand, surely we have to accept that to seek to 
influence is not enough. We need to be increasing awareness and affiliation, but with the ultimate aim of encouraging 
desired actions – which fundamentally is persuading isn’t it?

### The changing tools of persuasion

For those Mad Men ad execs mentioned previously, their tools of persuasion were the ‘megaphone’ media of advertising, in 
its various forms. I believe that the role of persuasion does remain, but the tools may now be different. In our 
networked world, persuasion doesn’t have to come directly from the ‘mouth’ of the organization. Harvard Business Review 
recently featured an article on the role of online peer-reviews in persuading people, finding that it is actually 
moderately positive reviews that are the most persuasive. We’ve also mentioned influence, and so can’t omit the 
‘persuasive powers’ of those social media influencers who seem to be so popular with some marketers these days. The 
ethics of some social media influencers may be questionable, with the recent claims of some beauty influencers offering 
to give negative reviews of competitor brands for $75k, but the fact that they are simply another way by which to 
persuade should be beyond doubt.

### Encourage people to want things

In rather apt timing, Tom Roach (Managing Partner BBH London) shared a tweet recently reminding me of the, admittedly 
very catchy, idea that it is now about ‘Making things people want’ rather than ‘Making people want things’. His point 
was that, although ‘Making things people want’ is important, we are in danger of forgetting how to ‘Make people want 
things’. I agree, although I don’t believe we can ‘make’ people want things, but surely it is incumbent on us to 
accept our role as persuaders. We obviously would like our clients or bosses to think that our work is encouraging 
desired actions, as if they didn’t then our jobs would surely be in question.

Of course, if we are persuading people to engage with or be interested in specific brands then I feel that we must 
believe that there genuinely is some value and benefit in the brand to people. As the excellent strategist Faris asked 
in a tweet when discussing this subject, is there ‘an ethical boundary to persuasion’?. I say that yes there is, but 
what is ethical to one person differs to what is ethical to another. What we are willing and prepared to seek to 
persuade people to do, or buy, or join, or believe, or share in, is a personal decision and should be guided by our 
own personal ethics.

### The tools of persuasion may have changed, but the art of persuasion remains an essential role for strategists.
