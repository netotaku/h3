Rob Lewis joined Halo earlier this month as Art Director. He comes with a wealth of brand experience spanning 15 years, 
an excellent creative thinker with an uncanny ability to get under the skin of any brief. He also comes with a great 
line in jackets and shoes. We’re super happy to have him with us, so naturally we decided to grill him and get the low 
down on all things Lewis.

### Quickfire Question!: Snog, Marry, Avoid: Ian Beale, Madonna & Katie Hopkins?

Snog Madonna, Marry Ian Beale because he’s not real, and avoid Katie Hopkins because I wish she wasn’t real!

### What’s been the proudest moment of your career?

I think as creatives we have a responsibility to use our skills to create change that can fix so many of the worlds 
problems. So my proudest moment so far is creating a simple proactive campaign called ‘Blanket Coverage’ that aims to 
keep homeless people warm during the long winter nights as well and raise awareness of the growing social problem in our 
cities.

### Tell us about your previous experiences that lead you to become an Art Director

I decided I wanted to work in advertising when at college. We studied the effects advertising has on business and 
popular culture. It was the late 90’s and the Levi's Flat Eric campaign had hit. Everyone had Flat Eric toys in their 
cars, and the song got to number one. I thought wow, imagine being the guy that came up with that! It inspired me to 
want to get into the industry in the hope that one day I’d work on creative that will influence popular culture like 
that.

### If you weren’t an Art Director and you could be anything else, what would you be?

I’d probably be the drummer from ColdPlay. You get the best of both worlds. You get all the money and privileges that 
come with fame, but as you’re the drummer no one knows who you are so you can still walk down the street and do what you 
want and you don’t get the blame for the music!

### If you were served up on a plate, what specialty dish would you be?

Bangers & Mash - simple cultural classic.

### If you could rebrand an existing company, who would it be and why?

If I could rebrand a company it would be the Alzheimers Society. My Mum used to be a carer for the local council and she 
would have to look after many Alzheimer suffers. The stories she would tell me were heart breaking. So, if I could use 
my skills to help make a positive impact towards the families and suffers that would be a big deal for me personally.

### If you were stranded on a desert island but conveniently a mixing deck washed up on shore, what would be your desert island discs?

* Massive Attack - Unfinished Sympathy
* Arcade Fire - Rebellion
* Jeff Buckley - So Real

### Would you rather have cheese strings for fingers or broccoli for genitals?

Cheese String fingers but they probably wouldn’t last long…

### Favourite drink to have with the boyz?

Old Fashion, mainly as I like to pretend I’m Don Draper.

### Finally, you’re 2 weeks in - how are you liking Halo and why did you want to work here?

Halo has been on my radar for a while and I really liked the work I saw coming out of the agency. On meeting the team it 
came quite apparent there is a real energy here to build brands that will influence popular culture and the opportunity 
to produce unexpected work that pushes the envelope. That’s a bit of me! So far, so great!
