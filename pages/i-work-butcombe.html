                    <br><br>
                    Butcombe Brewing Co.; a household name from the South West and
                    heritage brand of beer drinkers everywhere. Fighting for share in a crowded, continuously shifting market, Halo were the chosen partner
                    for the brand’s reinvention. We shaped a new strategic brand narrative, defining and creating opportunities for category growth, forged a complete revolution of visual identity and design for the traditional ale portfolio and created an entire brand architecture for a specialist, limited edition craft beer range. The resulting work won critical acclaim, and a World Beer Medal for brand design.                </p>

            <h2>Pedro Oyabide</h2>
            <p>Pedro was the natural choice for this project. A unique talent, his work is the perfect balance of bold ideas, sensitively rendered
                and realised for mass production without loss of vision or artistic value. Working closely with the Halo studio, whatever ideas we threw at Pedro, he was up for the challenge. A T Rex on fire? No problem.</p>

            <h2>‘Creating a craft range to celebrate all the things we missed whilst making Butcombe Original’</h2>
            <p>The shift in the consumer pallete towards punchier, heavy hopped IPA’s & mature Bocks has created space in the category for Butcombe’s seasonal, special edition brews. Each one is limited batch with a unique name & design created in honour of a landmark event or personality from 1978 - the year of the Brewery’s birth. The ‘78 Range has achieved significant retail listings & on-trade support, realised for mass production without loss of vision or artistic value.</p>

            <h2>The game changing beer</h2>
            <p>1978 saw the release of Space Invaders, the arcade game that changed the world with its iconic game play and design. Today, it remains a totem for a generation, taking us back to a simpler time, where saving the universe came in 8-bit and a handful of small change could last you the night. To celebrate this game changer, we’ve created a beer that’s a classic in its own right.</p>
