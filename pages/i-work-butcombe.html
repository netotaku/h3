                <blockquote>The Butcombe brand is beloved and respected by fans of traditional British ale across the UK & beyond. Halo immediately got straight to the heart of the brand, understanding our unique proposition with their impressive consumer insights and commercial approach. The results speak from themselves. Halo have revitalised the brand, created new revenue streams &amp; opened up markets for us in a way we hadn’t thought possible.

                <p>1978 saw the release of Space Invaders, the arcade game that changed the world with its iconic game play and design. Today, it remains a totem for a generation, taking us back to a simpler time, where saving the universe came in 8-bit and a handful of small change could last you the night. To celebrate this game changer, we’ve created a beer that’s a classic in its own right.</p>
