                <p class="typography--white">Butcombe Brewing Co.; a household name from the South West and heritage brand of beer drinkers everywhere. Fighting for share in a crowded, continuously shifting market, Halo were the chosen partner for the brand’s reinvention. We shaped a new strategic brand narrative, defining and creating opportunities for category growth, forged a complete revolution of visual identity and design for the traditional ale portfolio and created an entire brand architecture for a specialist, limited edition craft beer range. The resulting work won critical acclaim, and a World Beer Medal for brand design.</p>

                    <p>Pedro was the natural choice for this project. A unique talent, his work is the perfect balance of bold ideas, sensitively rendered and realised for mass production without loss of vision or artistic value. Working closely with the Halo studio, whatever ideas we threw at Pedro, he was up for the challenge. A T Rex on fire? No problem.</p>

Today, it remains a totem for a generation, taking us back to a simpler time, where saving the universe came in 8-bit and a handful of small change could last you the night. To celebrate this game changer, we’ve created a beer that’s a classic in its own right.</strong></p>
